It is located in the Queen&#8217;s Park area,London, NW6 (see <a href="contact.htm">map</a>). It is easily accessible bypublic transport, and car-parking facilities are excellent.</p><span class="band"> <img src="band4.jpg" border="4" alt="QP Bandstand"  /> </span><p>The course is designed for a small group of students, so that each can receive a great deal of individual attention.</p><P>The school occupies an entire ground floor of a Victorian house: a large,airy, well-equipped  teaching room facing Queen&#8217;s Park; cloakroom;bathroom; kitchen and conservatory. There is a good reference library. Ourlocation enables us to make frequent use of the park for outdoor work andactivities.</P><p>In line with STAT regulations, students are required to complete nineterms, each lasting 12 weeks, including one week mid-term break. Teachingruns from 09:00 to 13:00, Monday&#8211;Thursday.</p><P>Our daily communal light meal, as well as reading and discussion, takeplace in the conservatory or garden at the back of the house.</P><p>To download <font color=#cc0000><b>term dates</b></font>, <a href="TermDate.pdf">click here</a>.</p><p>The fees are &#163;1,675 per term, payable at the beginning of the term. Feesare subject to annual review.<p><font color=#cc0000><b>Curriculum</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Course contentfollows STAT Guidelines.  About 80 per cent of the teaching time is devotedto practical work.  This is the principal route towards understanding,experiencing and internalizing the fundamental concepts of F MAlexander&#8217;s discoveries: primary control, inhibition, directions,conscious control, unity of mind and body, means whereby and non-doing;supersession of end-gaining;  acknowledging the force of habit and ourdeficient proprioception.</p><p>The programme includes daily reading from classics of AT literature.Theoretical and practical work is devoted to anatomy and physiology, thenervous system, postural reflexes, vision and voice. Every effort is madeto include relevant topics requested by students. Each student getsintensive individual attention and is gradually guided to develop hands-onwork and other teaching skills.</p><P>To download our current <font color=#cc0000><b>weekly programme</b></font>, <ahref="WeekProg.pdf">click here</a>.</P><p><font color=#cc0000><b>Post-graduate programme</b></font>&nbsp; offered, byindividual arrangement, to qualified AT teachers.
