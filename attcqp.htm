<p>
<font color=#cc0000><b>General information</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; This
school for training AT teachers is  approved and moderated  by the Society
of Teachers of the Alexander Technique <a href="http://www.stat.org.uk"
target="_blank">(STAT)</a>. It is located in the Queen&#8217;s Park area,
London, NW6 (see <a href="contact.htm">map</a>). It is easily accessible by
public transport, and car-parking facilities are excellent.
</p>

<span class="band"> <img src="band4.jpg"

<p>
The course is designed for a small group of students, so that each can 
receive a great deal of individual attention.
</p>

<P>
The school occupies an entire ground floor of a Victorian house: a large,
airy, well-equipped  teaching room facing Queen&#8217;s Park; cloakroom;
bathroom; kitchen and conservatory. There is a good reference library. Our
location enables us to make frequent use of the park for outdoor work and
activities.
</P>

<p>
In line with STAT regulations, students are required to complete nine
terms, each lasting 12 weeks, including one week mid-term break. Teaching
runs from 09:00 to 13:00, Monday&#8211;Thursday.
</p>

<P>
Our daily communal light meal, as well as reading and discussion, take
place in the conservatory or garden at the back of the house.
</P>

</p>

<p>
The fees are &#163;1,675 per term, payable at the beginning of the term. Fees
are subject to annual review.

<p>
<font color=#cc0000><b>Curriculum</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Course content
follows STAT Guidelines.  About 80 per cent of the teaching time is devoted
to practical work.  This is the principal route towards understanding,
experiencing and internalizing the fundamental concepts of F M
Alexander&#8217;s discoveries: primary control, inhibition, directions,
conscious control, unity of mind and body, means whereby and non-doing;
supersession of end-gaining;  acknowledging the force of habit and our
deficient proprioception.
</p>

<p>
The programme includes daily reading from classics of AT literature.
Theoretical and practical work is devoted to anatomy and physiology, the
nervous system, postural reflexes, vision and voice. Every effort is made
to include relevant topics requested by students. Each student gets
intensive individual attention and is gradually guided to develop hands-on
work and other teaching skills.

individual arrangement, to qualified AT teachers. Options include:

<p>

welcome to visit the school (by prior appointment) and participate in our
