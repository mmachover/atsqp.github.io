They are based on <em>The AlexanderTechnique Birth Book</em>, which I co-authored with Angela and JonathanDrake (for details, click on &#8216;Publications&#8217; in the Navigationbar). The course is practical and theoretical, covering a range of topicsrelevant to pregnancy and birth. Participants learn to apply their ATskills to the special needs of expecting mothers. They train to conductsmall antenatal classes in which women and their partners are prepared forchildbirth using AT principles. The course also provides an introduction toworking as a doula. Support can be given to UK Participants who wish toconnect with Doula UK to pursue an accredited course.</p><p>A workshop runs for five consecutive days, or on five Sundays over severalmonths.  It is designed for up to 12 AT teachers and third-year ATtrainees.</p><h2> Dates </h2><p>To be announced.
