<h2>What is the Alexander Technique?</h2>

<p>
The Alexander Technique (AT) is a method of optimizing <em>use</em>.  This
refers to the way we use ourselves in everyday activities, as well as in
performance of special activities such as sports, music and acting.  It
helps to reduce stress and tension and economize effort.  <a class="pic"
href="http://alexandertechnique.co.uk" target="_blank"><span
class="stat"><img src="statn1.jpg" alt="STAT logo" border="0"
/></span></a>It is not a therapy: its practitioners do not regard
themselves as &lsquo;therapists&rsquo; treating &lsquo;patients&rsquo; but
as <em>teachers</em> who educate their <em>students</em> and instil good
use.  However, many aches and pains and other dysfunctions are due, at
least in part, to bad use; so by improving use the AT is able to remove or
attenuate the causes of these conditions and so contribute to well-being.
